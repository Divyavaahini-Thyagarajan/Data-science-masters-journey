"Building strong data science foundations, one step at a time"

This repository documents my ongoing academic learning and foundational practice during my
Master’s in Computer Science (Data Science & Analytics) at EPITA, France.

Currently in the early phase of the program, this repository reflects coursework, assignments, reports, and small projects that help me build a solid foundation in programming, algorithms, data governance, analytics, and professional skills.
